# How I made this website using Hugo

I recently started learning Hugo, a static site generator (SSG) written in Go. I was impressed by its speed and ease of use, and decided to use it to build my new website. Hugo is a great choice for anyone looking to build a fast and secure website.

I used the excellent [Hugo Profile](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile) theme as a starting point. I then customized the theme to fit my needs, adding features such as a search bar and a dark mode toggle.

I also used Hugo's built-in support for Markdown to write this blog. Markdown is a great choice for writing blog posts, as it is easy to read and write, and can be converted to HTML with ease.

Overall, I'm very happy with how this website turned out. Hugo is a great choice for anyone looking to build a fast and secure website, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to build a website.
